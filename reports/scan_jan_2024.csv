flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

vulnerabilities as referenced in the 2.4.54 advisory.

  - Possible request smuggling in mod_proxy_ajp: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request
    Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to
    the AJP server it forwards requests to.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4
    version 2.4.53 and prior versions. Acknowledgements: Ricter Z @ 360 Noah Lab (CVE-2022-26377)

  - Read beyond bounds in mod_isapi: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier on Windows may read beyond bounds
    when configured to process requests with the mod_isapi module.  Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server
    project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28330)

  - Read beyond bounds via ap_rwrite(): The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may
    read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite()
    or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project
    would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28614)

  - Read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match(): Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose
    information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input
    buffer.  While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or
    lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP
    Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28615)

  - Denial of service in mod_lua r:parsebody: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a
    lua script that calls r:parsebody(0) may cause a denial of service due to no default limit on possible
    input size. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop
    LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-29404)

  - Denial of Service mod_sed: If Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 is configured to do transformations with mod_sed in
    contexts where the input to mod_sed may be very large, mod_sed may make excessively large memory
    allocations and trigger an abort. Acknowledgements: This issue was found by Brian Moussalli from the JFrog
    Security Research team (CVE-2022-30522)

  - Information Disclosure in mod_lua with websockets: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths
    to applications calling r:wsread() that point past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer.
    Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for
    reporting this issue (CVE-2022-30556)

  - X-Forwarded-For dropped by hop-by-hop mechanism in mod_proxy: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may not
    send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server based on client side Connection header hop-by-hop
    mechanism. This may be used to bypass IP based authentication on the origin server/application.

    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.

able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
